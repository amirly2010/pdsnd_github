### Description
This project include all files about (BikeShare project using Git)

## Project 
In this project, Python was used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States
(Chicago, New York City, and Washington).
Python code was written to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and other information such as:
#1 Popular times of travel  i.e., occurs most often in the start time, (most common month / most common day of week / most common hour of day)
#2 Popular stations and trip (most common start station / most common end station / most common trip from start to end).
#3 Trip duration (total travel time / average travel time).
#4 User info (counts of each user type / counts of each gender / earliest, most recent, most common year of birth.
